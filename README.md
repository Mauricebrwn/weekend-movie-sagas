# Project Name

Weekend-movie-sagas

## Description

Duration- 2 day sprint

Over the course of a weekend we were tasked with using our knowledge of Redux, React, SQL Joins, and Sagas in order to refactor an app - and add a Detail view for each movie in their database.

## Approach
As this project had many components speaking to eachother I started with a DB design to help visualize the database table, relationships, and the flow.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js
- React.js
- Axios
- Redux
- Redux-Saga
- Express
- Body-Parser
- PG
- db designer

## Installation
1. Clone this repository for your own access.
2. Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
3. Using the provided data.sql file - set up a database.
4. Open two Terminal Tabs
5. Run npm run server and npm run clientin your terminal
6. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/

## Usage
This web application is meant to serve as a tool to view movies and details(title, description, and genre):

1. Using the provided movies on the home page - click the movie of your choice to see the details.
2. Once done, navigate back to the home page using the Back to home button 

## Developer Notes
If revisited I would love to be able to add a movie into the provided list. Also a search bar that allows to search by title or even genre.
